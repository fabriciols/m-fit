\hspace*{1.25cm}In the sector of Video Editorial, one of the biggest
demands is the detection of take transitions, which is basically the
cut of a take and the begin of another. This work have much
utilities in many applications, such as indexing, retrieval,
analysis and video editing. These transitions can occur in several
ways, such as: zooms, cuts, fades, and dissolve. This work presents
the M-FIT Motion Finder Integration, a framework that will let the
automatic detection of take transitions from a sample of images
(frames of a video) using techniques from Visual Rythim and
Mathematical Morphologie, allowing the exact point of transition is
obtained from a way practical and quickly. The M-FIT is a framework
developed in C language, with OpenCV (library to visual computing).
Your interface is made with QT, making M-FIT a system with a simple
interface and easy to understand, which will have many shortcuts to
another system features.
