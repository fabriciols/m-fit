\hspace*{1.25cm}In the field of Video Editing, the main goal is
detecting take transitions, which is basically the
connection of the end of one take to the begining of the next. This work
have much utilities in many applications, such as indexing, recovering,
analysing and video editing. These transitions can occur in several
ways, such as: zooms, cuts, fades, and dissolve. This work presents
the M-FIT, a framework that will let the
automatic detection of take transitions from a sample of images
(frames of a video) using techniques based on Visual Rhythm and
image segmentation that allow the exact point of transition 
obtained in a practical and quick way. The M-FIT is a framework
developed in C language, with OpenCV (library to visual computing).
The interface is made with QT, making M-FIT a system with a simple
interface and easy for all users.
